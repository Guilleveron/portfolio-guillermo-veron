      I'm Guillermo, a person who loves technology and is constantly looking to
      create software that improves the lives of as many people as possible. I
      specialize in creating software for clients ranging from individuals and
      small businesses to large enterprise corporations. I have developed
      specific products that solve the business needs of my clients. I have
      worked in software development, front-end/back-end web, ux/ui and database
      management. I have a passionate spirit that along with my natural problem
      solving skills help me to achieve my dreams and desires. I am never
      satisfied with just dreaming, but have an innate need to make them come
      true by acting accordingly step by step. I have a very good ability to
      learn and acquire new skills. You can read more details about my
      biography, experiences, skills and studies
